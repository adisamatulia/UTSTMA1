The iced coffee is very good and strong flavors, my eyes opened wider and my mouth poured with a bit of amazing flavor. Cozy atmosphere, chilled room, nice sofa, faster-served foods. It is a very good place to hang out and enjoy the food. It is my favorite place to spend the night. The price is normally compared to the other restaurants.

McDonald's Pandanaran,Crisopras ‚ÄúYŒõVL‚Äù Kainama,5.0,"Less than one year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American people and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams. That night, our new administration had already taken very swift action. A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land. Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission, to make America great again for all Americans. Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success. We have faced challenges we expected and others we could have never imagined. We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship. We have endured floods and fires and storms. But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America‚Äôs soul and the steel in America‚Äôs spine. Each test forged new American heroes to remind us who we are and show us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the Cajun Navy racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a totally devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip. We heard tales of Americans, like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery, with Melania. Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters in the scene used for Hurricane Harvey. 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved power lines ‚Äî downed power lines and deep water to save 40 lives. Ashlee, we all thank you. Thank you very much. We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg. He is here with us also. David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped in a California summer camp, threatened by those devastating wildfires. To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, everywhere, we are with you, we love you, and we always will pull through together, always. Thank you to David and the brave people of California. Thank you very much, David. Great job. Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally. With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this house, a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later. The legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise. I think they like you, Steve. We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the capitol police officers, the Alexandria police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life and the lives of many others and some in this room ‚Äî of many others, some in this room. In the aftermath of that terrible shooting we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people. But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy. Tonight, I call on all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people. This is really the key. These are the people we are elected to serve."

McDonald's,Dita,4.0,"The most crowded McDonald's in town. Since it is located in the heart of the town, inside a busy mall, near some hotel, offices and schools, the place is never quiet. This McDonald's is actually not really big but it has the infamous train seating, with a small locomotive, too. The tables are inside the train like area along the alley of the mall. At the back of the train, there is this ice cream corner where you can only order soft served ice cream, sundae or McFlurry. At the corner of the area, there is a small indoor playground for kids. The restaurant only has 2 toilets and you have to queue mort of the times.

But most of times I had to meet some colegians or students spending much longer time and in groups coz they are working on laptops or discussing assinments. Last time I dined...I had talked to a staff. Please share 1 set of table with maximum 6 chairs and set a signpost : WORKING STATION so they will only sit there. Not else where. Thanks
